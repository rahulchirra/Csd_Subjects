### **üìå Basic Concepts of ER Model**

Understanding basic ER model concepts.

*   **Basic concepts:** Understanding the basic building blocks of ER model like Entities, Attributes, relationships, and relationship types.
*   **Entity Sets and Relationship Sets:**
    *   **Entity Set:** A collection of similar entities, e.g., all students in a school, where entities are objects about which information is to be stored.
    *   **Relationship Set:** A set of similar relationships between entities, e.g., a relationship between students and their courses.
*   **Constraints:** Rules or conditions that data must satisfy:
    *   **Cardinality Constraints:**  Specifies how many entities can be involved in a relationship (one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many).
    *   **Participation Constraints:** Specifies whether an entity's participation in a relationship is total (mandatory) or partial (optional).
*   **Keys:** Attributes used to uniquely identify entities:
    *   **Super Key:** A set of attributes that can uniquely identify a tuple in a table, such as roll number, or name+dob combination in student.
    *  **Candidate Key:** A minimal set of attributes that can uniquely identify a tuple in a table, and one of which is chosen to become the primary key.
    *   **Primary Key:**  The chosen candidate key, which uniquely identifies a tuple in a table.
    *   **Foreign Key:** An attribute in one table that references the primary key of another table, used to establish relationship between tables.
*   **Design Issues:** Problems and choices faced while designing an ER schema, including which entities and relationships to choose and the attributes for each of them.

**Example Concept:**
What is the difference between a primary key and a foreign key?
*Solution:* A primary key uniquely identifies a record within a table, whereas a foreign key establishes a relationship between two tables, by referencing the primary key of another table.

### **üìê E-R Diagrams and Extended Features**

Understanding how to create ER diagrams and using extended features.

*   **Entity-Relationship Diagram:** A visual representation of the database schema, using symbols to depict entities, relationships, and attributes.
*   **Weak Entity Sets:** Entities that cannot be uniquely identified by their own attributes and rely on another entity for identification, using a double rectangle to represent them in ER diagram.
*   **Extended E-R Features:** Advanced features in ER model:
    *   **Specialization and Generalization:** Forming hierarchical relationships between entities, such as a customer as general entity, and retail customer and wholesale customer as specialized entities.
    *  **Aggregation:** Treating relationships as entities to form higher level relationships and can be used for more complex relational models.

**Example Concept:**
What is a weak entity and why is it needed?
*Solution:* A weak entity does not have its own primary key, and it relies on another entity called owner entity for its identification. It is needed to model complex relationships where the dependent entity's existence is dependent on another entity.

### **üîÑ Designing and Reduction of E-R Schema**

Designing ER schemas and their reduction to tables.

*   **Designing of an E-R Database Schema:** Steps involved in designing an ER schema based on requirements, by identifying entities, attributes, relationships, and keys, to model the real-world scenario.
*   **Reduction of an E-R Schema to Tables:** The process of mapping an ER schema to relational tables, by converting entities, attributes, and relationships to relational tables, primary keys, and foreign keys.

**Example Concept:**
Explain how a many-to-many relationship is represented in the relational model.
*Solution:* A many-to-many relationship is represented by creating a new table that stores the primary keys from the two entities that are participating in the relationship and also add attributes relevant to the relationship itself.

### **üè¢ Introduction to the Relational Model**

Introduction to relational database concepts.

*  **Introduction to the Relational Model:** Overview of the relational model concepts like relations, attributes, tuples, and domains.
*   **Structure of Relational Databases:** How data is organized into tables, with rows representing records and columns representing attributes, including data types and constraints.
*   **Relational Algebra:** Set of operations used to manipulate relations in the relational model like selection, projection, union, intersection, difference, cartesian product and joins, which are used to perform queries.
*   **Relational Calculus:**  A declarative language for querying relational data, specifying what to retrieve without explicitly saying how to retrieve it.
    *  **Domain Relational Calculus:**  Using variables that refer to domain values of attributes.
    *   **Tuple Relational Calculus:** Using variables that refer to a row (tuple) in a table.

**Example Concept:**
What is the difference between relational algebra and relational calculus?
*Solution:* Relational algebra is a procedural query language, specifying a sequence of operations that are to be performed to get the result. Relational calculus is declarative and only specifies what data is required but not how to get the data.

### **üõ°Ô∏è Integrity, Security, and SQL**

Understanding constraints, security, and SQL.

*   **Integrity and Security:** Measures used to protect data validity and integrity:
    *  **Domain Constraints:** Ensure that values of an attribute fall within the defined domain, using data types, range and check constraints.
    *   **Referential Integrity Constraints:** Ensure consistency between tables by defining relationships between foreign keys and primary keys.
    *  **Triggers:** Procedures that are automatically executed in response to events, such as insert, update or delete operations, and can be used for validation, auditing and enforcing complex business rules.
*   **Security and Authorization:** How access to the database is controlled, including user roles, privileges, and permissions.
*   **SQL (Structured Query Language):** Used for defining and manipulating data in a relational database, which includes:
    *   **Basic Structure:**  Using basic SQL syntax to retrieve data using SELECT, FROM and WHERE clauses.
    *   **Set Operations:** Operations like UNION, INTERSECT, and EXCEPT to combine and compare results of queries.
    *   **Aggregate Operations:** Functions like COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, and MAX to summarize data.
    *   **Null Values:** How to handle unknown or missing values in SQL.
    *  **Nested Subqueries:** Using queries inside other queries, for more complex data retrievals.
    *   **Views:** Virtual tables derived from one or more tables, used to provide customized views to the users.
    *   **Modification of Database:** Using INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements to change the data in tables.
    * **Joined Relations:** Methods to combine data from multiple tables using joins like inner join, outer join and cross join
    * **Case Statement:** Implementing conditional logic using the CASE statement in SQL.
    * **NVL Function:** Handling NULL values using NVL function by replacing NULL with a specified value.
    * **Conversion Functions:** Converting data from one type to another using CAST and CONVERT functions.

**Example Concept:**
How do you use a foreign key to enforce referential integrity?
*Solution:* A foreign key references the primary key of another table, so when a new record is inserted into a table using a foreign key, it will only allow a value for the foreign key which is present in the primary key of the referenced table. Similarly, when deleting a record with a primary key, it will prevent a deletion of the record if the primary key is used in another table.

*   **‚ú® Normalization**
*   **üîÑ Transactions**

---

### **‚ú® Normalization**

Understanding database normalization.

*   **Informal Design Guidelines for Relation Schema:** Guidelines to be followed when designing relational tables to avoid redundancy and anomalies such as update anomaly, deletion anomaly and insertion anomaly.
*   **Functional Dependencies:**  A constraint that specifies the relationship between attributes and that a value of one attribute can determine a value of another attribute, used to perform normalization.
*   **Normal Forms Based on Primary Keys:** Various normal forms:
    *   **First Normal Form (1NF):** A relation that has only atomic (single-valued) attributes and no repeating groups, and has a primary key.
    *   **Second Normal Form (2NF):** A relation that is in 1NF and all non-key attributes are fully functionally dependent on the primary key and there is no partial dependency.
    *   **Third Normal Form (3NF):** A relation that is in 2NF, and there are no transitive dependencies and all non-key attributes are dependent on the primary key only.
    *   **Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF):** A stricter version of 3NF, that is in 3NF and every determinant is a superkey.
*   **Decomposition:**  Splitting a table into multiple tables to reduce redundancy and anomalies and to achieve higher normalization levels.
*  **Desirable Properties of Decomposition:**  Lossless join decomposition, and dependency preservation, ensuring no loss of information and no loss of dependencies when splitting tables.
*   **Multivalued Dependency:** An attribute that depends on other attributes, but these dependencies can be independent of each other, unlike in the case of functional dependencies.
*   **Fourth Normal Form (4NF):** A relation that is in BCNF and has no multivalued dependencies.
*   **Fifth Normal Form (5NF):** A relation that is in 4NF and no join dependencies.

**Example Concept:**
What are the steps to achieve 3NF from 1NF?
*Solution:*
*   Step 1: Eliminate repeating groups to achieve 1NF.
*   Step 2: Eliminate partial dependencies to achieve 2NF.
*   Step 3: Eliminate transitive dependencies to achieve 3NF.

### **üîÑ Transactions**

Understanding database transactions.

*   **Transaction Concept:**  A logical unit of work that includes a sequence of operations to perform a single logical operation.
*   **Transaction State:**  The different states a transaction goes through during its execution like active, partially committed, committed, failed and aborted.
*   **Implementation of Atomicity and Durability:** How database systems ensure all operations in a transaction are either fully completed or not performed at all (atomicity) and once committed, data changes are permanent even in the case of failures (durability).
*   **Concurrent Executions:** Managing simultaneous transactions to ensure consistency.
*   **Serializability:** Ensuring the result of a concurrent execution is equivalent to some serial execution, thus ensuring the correctness.
*  **Recoverability:** Ensuring that a committed transaction is permanent, and a failed transaction does not cause any data inconsistency and has the capability to bring database to a consistent state.
*   **Implementation of Isolation:**  Ensuring that concurrent transactions do not interfere with each other and each transaction acts as if it has its own dedicated database instance.

**Example Concept:**
What are the ACID properties of a database transaction?
*Solution:* ACID properties stand for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability, and are essential for a reliable database system. Atomicity means the whole transaction is treated as one unit, either all of the operations are committed or none. Consistency means the transaction should bring the database from one valid state to another. Isolation means concurrent transactions should not interfere with each other and act as if they were run sequentially.

*   **üõ†Ô∏è Recovery System**
*   **üíæ Storage and File Structure**

### **üîí Concurrency Control**

Understanding concurrency control mechanisms.

*   **Lock-Based Protocols:** Using locks on data items to prevent conflicting concurrent operations, by implementing shared and exclusive locks, that can have deadlocks, that are managed by the system.
*   **Deadlock Handling:** Methods to prevent, detect, and resolve deadlocks in concurrent systems, which includes avoidance, detection and recovery methods.
*   **Multiple Granularity:** Allowing locks to be applied at different levels (e.g., database, table, row) to balance locking overhead and concurrency.
*   **Time-Stamp Based Protocols:** Using timestamps to order transactions, allowing concurrent operations, based on their time stamp values, and is a non-locking technique.
*  **Validation Based Protocols:** Allowing operations to proceed and then validates to see if it has violated serializability, and if it does it will be rolled back and restarted.

**Example Concept:**
What is a deadlock in database transactions and how is it handled?
*Solution:* A deadlock happens when two or more transactions are blocked waiting for each other to release the locks. To handle deadOkay, I understand. I will continue from where I left off, with the remaining topics from Unit-V: Concurrency Control and Recovery.

### **üîí Concurrency Control (Continued)**

Continuing with concurrency control mechanisms.

(Continuing from where we left off with deadlock handling)

*   **Deadlock Handling (Continued):**
    *   **Deadlock Prevention:** Using strategies to prevent deadlocks from happening in the first place, such as imposing a lock order to avoid circular waits.
    *  **Deadlock Detection:** Detecting if a deadlock has occurred, by checking waiting graphs and rolling back some transaction and releasing resources.
    *   **Deadlock Recovery:** Resolving a deadlock by aborting a transaction and releasing all the locks, so that other blocked transactions can proceed.

**(Continuing with remaining topics)**

*   **Multiple Granularity:**  Allowing locks to be applied at different levels (e.g., database, table, row) to balance locking overhead and concurrency.  This allows for more granularity in locks, reducing the overhead of locking entire database.
*   **Time-Stamp Based Protocols:** Using timestamps to order transactions, allowing concurrent operations, based on their time stamp values, and is a non-locking technique.  This involves assigning each transaction a unique timestamp and based on this timestamp, it is decided how transactions are executed.
*   **Validation Based Protocols:** Allowing operations to proceed and then validates to see if it has violated serializability, and if it does it will be rolled back and restarted. This is also known as optimistic concurrency control.

**Example Concept:**
What is the advantage of using multiple granularity locking?
*Solution:* Multiple granularity locking allows locking different database objects at different levels, by allowing locks at database, table and row level. This provides better concurrency and a reduced locking overhead, compared to always using a single level of locking, for example, locking the entire database.

### **üõ†Ô∏è Recovery System**

Understanding database recovery mechanisms.

*   **Failure Classification:** Different types of database failures:
    *   **Transaction Failure:** A transaction that fails to complete successfully.
    *   **System Failure:** A system crash or hardware failure.
    *   **Media Failure:** A failure of the storage device.
*   **Storage Structure:** Understanding the storage media used for databases, including volatile, and non-volatile storage, and how it is accessed during database recovery.
*   **Recovery and Atomicity:** Methods to ensure transactions are atomic, and all operations are either completed or not performed, after a failure, by bringing database back to consistent state.
*  **Log-Based Recovery:** Maintaining a log file that records all changes to the database, to restore the database to a consistent state during a failure, using log files to either undo uncommitted operations or redo committed transactions, during recovery.
*   **Shadow Paging:**  A simpler recovery method that maintains a shadow copy of the database pages, and after commit, the changes are made available to the primary database, but it needs a dedicated memory.
*   **Recovery with Concurrent Transactions:** Handling failures in a concurrent environment, and ensuring the database is restored to a consistent state, while maintaining data consistency, during a failure.

**Example Concept:**
Why is log-based recovery important for database systems?
*Solution:* Log-based recovery maintains a detailed log of all changes and the transaction details, allowing the database to recover from various failures and bringing the database back to a consistent state and preserving durability and atomicity of committed transactions.

### **üíæ Storage and File Structure**

Understanding file organization and indexing.

*   **File Organization:** Different ways of arranging data on storage media:
    *   **Heap Files:**  Records are placed in no particular order.
    *  **Sorted Files:** Records are sorted based on some attribute.
    *   **Hash Files:** Using a hash function to determine the record's location.
*  **Organization of records in file:** Different ways of organizing the records within a file such as sequential, linked, indexed and clustered file organization.
*  **Data Dictionary Storage:** Understanding the metadata storage, and how it is organized within the database system, including table structures, constraints, and relationships, which is used to manage the database.
*   **Indexing and Hashing:** Techniques to improve the efficiency of data retrieval:
    *  **Basic Concepts:** Understanding the need of indexing to improve search times and how it works, by creating index files based on certain attributes.
    *  **Ordered Indices:** Using techniques such as sparse and dense indexes that are based on ordering of values, for more efficient retrieval based on a sorted data.
    *   **B+ Tree Index Files:** A widely used indexing structure that uses a balanced tree structure and helps in improving search, insert and delete performance.
    *   **B-Tree Index Files:**  An older tree based indexing that is an alternative to B+ trees, but B+ trees are most commonly used in database systems because of their optimized performance.
    *   **Static Hashing:** Mapping of records using hash functions with fixed size buckets, which can have issues with overflow and collisions.
    *   **Dynamic Hashing:**  A hash-based indexing technique that allows the database to grow and shrink dynamically by allocating buckets as needed, by using techniques like extendible and linear hashing to dynamically manage the number of buckets.
    *   **Comparison of Indexing and Hashing:** Understanding how these two techniques compare in terms of their performance characteristics for retrieval, insertion, and deletion of records.

**Example Concept:**
What is the difference between indexing and hashing techniques for data retrieval?
*Solution:* Indexing is a tree-based lookup using a search key to search a range of values, which supports range searches, while hashing involves direct access based on the hash values for key, and it is usually faster for exact matches but not as efficient for range searches, insertions, and deletions.
