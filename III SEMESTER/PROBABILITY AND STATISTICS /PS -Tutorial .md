### **🎲 Basic Probability**

Fundamental concepts of probability theory.

*   **Probability Spaces:** A sample space, the set of all possible outcomes, events as subsets of the sample space, and the concept of a probability measure that assigns probabilities to events, usually using axioms of probability.
*   **Conditional Probability:** The probability of an event occurring given that another event has already occurred, using the formula P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B)
*   **Independent Events:** Two events where the occurrence of one does not affect the probability of the other, represented by the formula P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B)
*   **Bayes’ Theorem:** A fundamental theorem that describes how to update the probabilities of a hypothesis given evidence, using the formula P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

**Example Concept:**
What is the difference between independent events and mutually exclusive events?
*Solution:* Independent events are those where the occurrence of one does not affect the occurrence of the other. Mutually exclusive events cannot happen simultaneously. If two events are mutually exclusive, they cannot be independent. If two events are independent, they are not necessarily mutually exclusive.

### **📊 Random Variables**

Understanding random variables and their properties.

*   **Discrete Random Variables:** Variables that can only take on a finite number of values or a countably infinite number of values, each of which can be described by a probability mass function.
*   **Continuous Random Variables:** Variables that can take on any value within a given range, described by a probability density function.
*   **Expectation of Random Variables:** The mean or average value of a random variable, calculated as a weighted average of possible values and their probabilities (discrete) or an integral (continuous).
*   **Variance of Random Variables:** A measure of how spread out the values of a random variable are around its mean, calculated as the expected value of the squared deviation from the mean.

**Example Concept:**
What is the difference between a discrete and a continuous random variable?
*Solution:* A discrete random variable has countable values (like number of heads in a coin toss, where values can be 0,1,2, etc). A continuous random variable can take any value within a range (like height, weight, temperature).

### 📚 Table of Contents

*   **📊 Binomial Distribution**
*   **🔢 Poisson Distribution**

---

### **📊 Binomial Distribution**

Understanding the binomial distribution.

*   **Binomial Distribution:** The probability distribution of the number of successes in a fixed number of independent trials, each with the same probability of success, with a probability mass function, and probability and parameters calculated based on number of trials and probability of success.
*   **Evaluation of Statistical Parameters:**
    *   **Mean (Expectation):**  Calculated as n * p, where n is the number of trials and p is the probability of success.
    *   **Variance:** Calculated as n * p * (1-p), where n is the number of trials and p is the probability of success.

**Example Concept:**
In a binomial distribution, if a coin is tossed 5 times with the probability of heads as 0.5, calculate mean and variance.
*Solution:*
*   Mean = n*p = 5 * 0.5 = 2.5
*   Variance = n * p * (1-p) = 5 * 0.5 * 0.5 = 1.25

### **🔢 Poisson Distribution**

Understanding the Poisson distribution.

*   **Poisson Distribution:** The probability distribution of the number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space, given a constant average rate of occurrence with probability mass function defined by rate parameter lambda, and calculates probability of specific number of events.
*   **Evaluation of Statistical Parameters:**
    *   **Mean (Expectation):**  Equal to the rate parameter lambda.
    *   **Variance:** Also equal to the rate parameter lambda.
*   **Poisson Approximation to the Binomial Distribution:** How the Poisson distribution can be used to approximate the binomial distribution when the number of trials is large and the probability of success is small, by setting lambda = np.

**Example Concept:**
If a Poisson distribution has a mean of 3, what is its variance?
*Solution:*
In Poisson distribution, mean and variance are equal, so variance is 3.

### **📈 Continuous Random Variables and Properties**

Understanding continuous random variables and their properties.

*   **Continuous Random Variables and their Properties:**  Understanding that continuous random variables can take any value within a given range, described by probability density function.
*   **Distribution Functions and Densities:**
    *   **Distribution Function (CDF):** The probability that the random variable takes a value less than or equal to a certain value.
    *   **Probability Density Function (PDF):** Describes the relative likelihood of a random variable taking on a given value and is the derivative of the CDF.

**Example Concept:**
What is the relation between CDF and PDF for a continuous random variable?
*Solution:* The Probability Density Function (PDF) is the derivative of the Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF). The CDF gives the probability that the variable is less than or equal to a value, and the PDF gives the likelihood of the variable being at a particular value.

### **📊 Uniform, Exponential, and Normal Distributions**

Understanding common continuous distributions.

*   **Uniform Distribution:** A distribution where all values in a given range have equal probability.
    *   **Mean (Expectation):** Calculated as (a+b)/2, where a and b are the range limits.
    *   **Variance:** Calculated as (b-a)^2 / 12, where a and b are the range limits.
*   **Exponential Distribution:** A distribution describing the time between events in a Poisson process and has only one parameter lambda, and is useful for describing the lifetime of components and time between events.
    *   **Mean (Expectation):** Calculated as 1 / lambda, where lambda is the rate parameter.
    *   **Variance:** Calculated as 1 / lambda^2, where lambda is the rate parameter.
*   **Normal Distribution:**  A bell-shaped distribution described by two parameters: mean (mu) and variance (sigma squared). The distribution is symmetric around the mean, and many natural phenomena tend to be approximated by a normal distribution.
    *   **Mean (Expectation):**  Equal to the parameter mu.
    *   **Variance:** Equal to the parameter sigma^2.

**Example Concept:**
What is the shape of a normal distribution?
*Solution:* The normal distribution is bell-shaped and symmetrical, with most of the data centered around the mean. The curve tails off on both sides and is described by two parameters: mean and variance.

*   **Rank Correlation:** Correlation calculated using ranks instead of actual values, suitable for non-linear data, by ranking the values based on their values and using Spearman rank correlation or Kendall tau rank correlation.

**Example Concept:**
What does a correlation coefficient of 0.8 indicate?
*Solution:* A correlation coefficient of 0.8 indicates a strong positive linear relationship between two variables. As one variable increases, the other variable tends to increase too.

### **🔬 Test of Significance - Large Samples**

Hypothesis testing for large samples.

*   **Test of Significance:**  A method to determine whether there is enough statistical evidence to reject a null hypothesis and accept the alternative hypothesis, and is used for statistical inference.
*   **Large Sample Test for Single Proportion:** A statistical test used to test a hypothesis about a single population proportion using Z test.

### **🧪 Test of Significance - Small Samples**

Hypothesis testing for small samples.

*   **Test for Single Mean for Small Samples:**  Statistical test used to test a hypothesis about a single population mean when the sample size is small, using t test instead of z test.
*   **Test for Difference of Means for Small Samples:** Statistical test used to test a hypothesis about the difference between two population means when the sample size is small using t test.
*  **Test for Ratio of Variances for Small Samples:** A statistical test used to test a hypothesis about the ratio of two population variances, using the F-test.

**Example Concept:**
Why use a t-test instead of a Z-test for small samples?
*Solution:* When the sample size is small (typically n < 30), the sample variance is not a good estimate for the population variance. The t-distribution accounts for this extra variability, making it more appropriate for small samples.
