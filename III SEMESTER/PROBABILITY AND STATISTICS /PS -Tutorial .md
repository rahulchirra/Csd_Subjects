### 3. 🧪 Large Sample Test for Difference of Proportions

Hypothesis testing for the difference between two population proportions.

-   **Difference in Sample Proportions:** Estimate of the difference in population proportions.
-   **Z-test:** Test statistic for difference of proportions.
-   **Test Procedure**: Similar to test for single proportion, but involves sample proportions from two populations.

**Example Problem:**
A survey conducted in two different cities shows that 60% like product A in city 1 and 70% like the same product in city 2. Can it be concluded that the proportion is significantly different between the two cities?
*Solution:* Use a large sample test for difference in proportions to test for hypothesis that proportions are same or different in the two cities.

### 4. 🧪 Large Sample Test for Single Mean

Hypothesis testing for a single population mean.

-   **Sample Mean:** Estimate of population mean.
-   **Z-test:** Test statistic for means when population standard deviation is known.
-   **Test procedure**: Similar to the test for proportions but the test statistic used is Z test for means.

**Example Problem:**
A company claims that the average life of a light bulb is 1000 hours. A sample shows the average life is 950 hours, with a known population standard deviation. Is the claim valid?
*Solution:* A Z-test for the mean is to be used here to test the hypothesis, by comparing the test statistic with critical values at a given significance level.

### 5. 🧪 Large Sample Test for Difference of Means

Hypothesis testing for the difference between two population means.

-   **Difference in Sample Means:** Estimate of the difference in population means.
-   **Z-test:** Test statistic for difference of means.
-  **Test procedure**: Similar to test for single mean but sample means are taken from two different samples.

**Example Problem:**
The mean score of students in subject A is 80 and in subject B is 75 from different samples. Can it be concluded that both the means are different significantly? Assume population variances are known.
*Solution:* Use a large sample test for difference in means here using Z-test to check if the two means are different.

### 6. 🧪 Test for Single Mean (Small Samples)

Hypothesis testing for a single population mean when the sample size is small.

-   **T-Test:** Used when the population variance is unknown.
-   **Degrees of Freedom:** Used to determine the critical values from t-distribution table.
-  **Test Procedure**: Similar to test for large sample but test statistic and critical values are taken from t-distribution table.

**Example Problem:**
A sample of 20 items gave an average of 15 with a sample standard deviation of 3. If the population average is 16, is there evidence that the claim is wrong?
*Solution:* Use one sample t-test here since population standard deviation is not known and a sample size is small. The test statistic will be calculated and compared with values in the t-table.

### 7. 🧪 Test for Difference of Means (Small Samples)

Hypothesis testing for the difference between two population means when sample sizes are small.

-  **T-Test:** Used when population variance is unknown.
- **Independent Samples**: Hypothesis test when samples are independent.
- **Paired Samples**: Hypothesis testing when samples are dependent.

**Example Problem:**
Two different teaching methods were tried on two different sets of students. The mean scores in the test were 75 and 80 respectively, with given sample standard deviations and sample sizes for both the groups.
*Solution:* Use t-test here for the difference of means to check if there is difference between means of both methods, this can be done for both independent and paired samples.

### 8. 🧪 Test for Ratio of Variances (Small Samples)

Hypothesis testing for the ratio of two population variances.

-  **F-Test:** Used to compare sample variances.
-  **F-distribution**: Distribution used for hypothesis test for the ratio of variances.
-  **Test Procedure**: Calculating the test statistic, comparing the test statistic with F-table values.

**Example Problem:**
Two machines are producing the same type of items. Is there a significant difference in the variation of quality using the F test of variances by using samples from the two machines?
*Solution:* Calculate F-test statistic using sample variances, and then compare the calculated F-statistic with the F table value to check for the hypothesis about equality of variances.
