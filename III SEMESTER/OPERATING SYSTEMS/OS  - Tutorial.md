### 9. ✒️ Copy-on-Write

Technique used for memory management, used when creating a new process.
 -  **Copy-on-write:** When a new process is created it shares the memory of parent process.
 - Only when the processes try to modify a shared page, copy of page is made for that process.
 - This reduces memory usage and improves performance.
