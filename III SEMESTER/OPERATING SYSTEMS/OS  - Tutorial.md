###  **‚è±Ô∏è Process Scheduling**

Understanding process scheduling algorithms.

*   **Basic Concepts:** Scheduling concepts like CPU utilization, throughput, turnaround time, waiting time, and response time.
*   **Scheduling Criteria:** Performance metrics used to evaluate scheduling algorithms, like fairness, CPU utilization, throughput, turnaround time, waiting time, and response time.
*   **Scheduling Algorithms:**
    *   **First-Come, First-Served (FCFS):** Processes are executed in the order of their arrival.
    *   **Shortest Job First (SJF):** Processes with the shortest execution time are scheduled first.
    *   **Priority Scheduling:** Processes are scheduled based on their priority, with higher priority processes being scheduled first.
    *   **Round Robin (RR):**  Each process is given a fixed time slice of the CPU, and after the time slice, the CPU is given to next process in a round-robin fashion.
    *   **Multilevel Queue Scheduling:**  Multiple ready queues, each with its own scheduling algorithm, such as foreground and background queues.
*   **Algorithm Evaluation:** Evaluating the performance of scheduling algorithms based on different criteria, such as through simulation, and mathematical modeling.

**Example Concept:**
Explain the difference between preemptive and non-preemptive scheduling.
*Solution:* In preemptive scheduling, the OS can interrupt a running process if a higher-priority process arrives. In non-preemptive scheduling, a process runs until it completes or voluntarily yields control to the OS.

### **ü§ù Synchronization**

Understanding process synchronization techniques.

*   **Background:**  Understanding the need for synchronization and the issues that can arise in concurrent processing such as race conditions, and critical section problem.
*   **The Critical-Section Problem:**  The need to protect shared resources and critical sections of the code from concurrent access and ensuring only one process accesses it at a time.
*   **Peterson's Solution:** A software-based approach to solve the critical section problem using only two processes.
*   **Synchronization Hardware:**  Hardware mechanisms to support synchronization, such as test-and-set and compare-and-swap instructions.
*   **Mutex Locks:**  A basic synchronization tool that allows only one thread to access the critical section at a time.
*   **Semaphores:**  A more advanced synchronization mechanism that can be used to control access to multiple resources, and provide a more powerful tool for managing concurrency using wait and signal operations.
*  **Classic Problems of Synchronization:**  Classic concurrency problems like producer-consumer, readers-writers, and dining philosophers, and how to solve these by using synchronization mechanisms.
*   **Monitors:** A higher-level synchronization construct that uses monitor procedures and data to protect shared variables, providing a structured way for synchronization.

**Example Concept:**
What is the role of a semaphore in process synchronization?
*Solution:* Semaphores are used to control access to shared resources by maintaining a count of available resources. Processes use wait and signal operations to request and release the resources, ensuring mutual exclusion and synchronization among processes.

*   **üß† Memory-Management Strategies**
*   **üíΩ Virtual-Memory Management**

---

### **üß† Memory-Management Strategies**

Understanding different memory management techniques.

*   **Background:**  Understanding the need for memory management, memory hierarchy, and addressing schemes.
*   **Swapping:**  Moving processes between main memory and secondary storage to allow more processes to be in active state and improve the overall CPU utilization and throughput.
*   **Contiguous Memory Allocation:** Allocating a contiguous block of memory to each process, including single partitioning, and variable partitioning techniques.
*   **Segmentation:** Dividing memory into logical segments of variable size, corresponding to logical divisions of a process, for example, code, data, and stack segments, and allows each segment to be located anywhere in the main memory.
*   **Paging:** Dividing memory into fixed size pages, and allocating pages to processes, providing a simpler way to manage memory by keeping track of the pages for each process.
*  **Structure of the Page Table:** Organization of page tables, including single level, multi level, inverted page tables, and its entry, which contains information about the mapping of virtual to physical pages and additional control bits.

**Example Concept:**
What is the main difference between segmentation and paging?
*Solution:* Segmentation divides memory into variable-sized logical units, while paging divides memory into fixed-sized physical units, which improves memory management efficiency and reduces external fragmentation. Segmentation is done based on logical structure and paging is based on physical units.

### **üíΩ Virtual-Memory Management**

Exploring virtual memory management concepts.

*   **Demand Paging:** Loading pages into memory only when they are needed, using a lazy loader approach, rather than loading all pages of the process and this method allows more processes to be active at the same time.
*  **Copy-on-Write:** Allows parent and child processes to initially share the same pages, until one process modifies a page, and then a copy of the modified page is created, improving resource utilization.
*   **Page Replacement:** Algorithms used to decide which page to remove when a new page needs to be loaded and main memory is full, such as First In First Out, Optimal, Least Recently Used, and Least Frequently Used.
*   **Thrashing:**  A condition where the system spends more time swapping pages than executing processes, leading to very poor performance and is due to excessive paging.

**Example Concept:**
Why is demand paging important in virtual memory management?
*Solution:* Demand paging allows the system to execute processes that are larger than the physical memory size, by loading only the pages that are currently required. This method significantly improves the efficiency of memory utilization by delaying the loading of pages until they are needed.

### **üíÄ Deadlocks**

Understanding the nature and handling of deadlocks.

*  **System Model:** System resources, processes and the allocation of resources in a computer system.
*   **Deadlock Characterization:**  Necessary conditions for deadlock: mutual exclusion, hold and wait, no preemption, and circular wait.
*   **Methods for Handling Deadlocks:**  Strategies for preventing, avoiding, detecting, and recovering from deadlocks.
*  **Deadlock Prevention:** Methods to prevent any of the four necessary conditions for deadlocks, and are often impractical, due to decreased resource utilization.
*   **Deadlock Avoidance:** Using resource allocation strategies to avoid deadlocks, such as using banker's algorithm, to ensure the system will never be in an unsafe state.
*  **Deadlock Detection:** Detecting whether a deadlock has occurred, usually by checking for circular wait dependencies in resource allocation graphs.
*   **Recovery from Deadlock:**  Resolving the deadlock, such as aborting one or more processes or preempting resources.

**Example Concept:**
Explain the four necessary conditions for a deadlock.
*Solution:* Deadlock requires these conditions simultaneously:
*   Mutual exclusion: Only one process can access a resource at a time.
*  Hold and wait: A process holding at least one resource is waiting to acquire resources held by another process.
*   No preemption: Resources cannot be forcibly taken away from a process.
*   Circular wait:  Two or more processes form a circular chain, such that each process is waiting for the resource held by the next process in the chain.

### **üíæ Implementing File Systems**

Exploring file system implementation details.

*   **File-System Structure:** How different components of a file system interact, including the file system layers such as file system interface, file organization and file allocation mechanism.
*   **File-System Implementation:** Various techniques for managing the file system metadata, file organization, and storage space.
*   **Directory Implementation:** Methods for storing and managing directory information, including linear list and hash tables.
*   **Allocation Methods:** Different methods for allocating disk space for files:
    *   **Contiguous Allocation:** Allocating contiguous blocks for a file.
    *  **Linked Allocation:** Allocating non-contiguous blocks and linking them together using pointers.
    *   **Indexed Allocation:** Creating an index block for each file, that stores the pointers to the blocks used by the file, which supports both sequential and random access to data.
*   **Free-Space Management:**  Techniques for managing the free disk space, using methods such as bit maps, linked lists and grouping methods.

**Example Concept:**
What are the advantages of linked allocation compared to contiguous allocation?
*Solution:* Linked allocation avoids external fragmentation by using linked lists of non-contiguous disk blocks for a file. It also allows files to grow dynamically, whereas contiguous allocation needs a contiguous block, which is hard to allocate in a system with many files.

### **üíΩ Mass Storage Structure**

Understanding mass storage systems.

*   **Overview of Mass Storage Structure:** Introduction to mass storage devices like magnetic disks, SSDs, and other storage media, and their characteristics.
*   **Disk Structure:** Understanding disk platters, tracks, sectors, and cylinders, along with the concepts of physical and logical addresses.
*   **Disk Attachment:** How disks are attached to a computer system, including interfaces like IDE, SATA, and SCSI, USB and network storage.
*   **Disk Scheduling:** Algorithms used to optimize disk I/O performance, such as First-Come, First-Served (FCFS), Shortest Seek Time First (SSTF), SCAN, and LOOK.
*   **Disk Management:** How the OS formats, partitions, and manages the disk space.
*   **RAID Structure:** Various Redundant Array of Independent Disks (RAID) levels, for improving performance, reliability and availability.
*   **Swap space Management:**  How the OS manages swap space on disk, used for virtual memory.

**Example Concept:**
Explain the difference between SSTF and SCAN disk scheduling algorithms.
*Solution:* SSTF (Shortest Seek Time First) selects the request closest to the current disk head position, and may cause starvation of requests on the outer tracks. SCAN moves the disk head in one direction servicing all requests in that direction, and reverses direction at the ends of disk, thus avoiding starvation of requests.

### **üõ°Ô∏è System Protection**

Understanding system protection and security.

*   **System Protection:** Techniques used by operating systems to protect system resources and data from unauthorized access, misuse and malware.
*  **Goals of Protection:** Protecting system resources, data, and ensuring integrity of the system from malicious or accidental damage by restricting the access to authorized users.
*   **Principles of Protection:** Applying the principle of least privilege, defense in depth, and separation of privilege to implement a strong system security.
*   **Domain of Protection:** Defining different protection domains where each domain defines set of resource access permissions, and a domain can be assigned to users or programs.
*   **Access Matrix:** A model to represent access rights of subjects to different objects using a table to define permissions for each subject for each resource, and is an implementation of a protection domain.
*  **Implementation of Access Matrix:** Implementing access control using access lists, and capability lists to restrict unauthorized access to resources.
*   **Access Control:**  Various methods for granting, controlling, and revoking user permissions for files and resources, using access control list and role based access control.
*   **Revocation of Access Rights:** Removing access rights when a user or process no longer needs them.
*  **Capability-Based Systems:** Systems that give processes capabilities or tickets to access resources, by issuing rights to processes to access resources.
*   **Language-Based Protection:** Using programming languages and compiler technology to enforce system security at a higher level using type safety and access control enforcement, during programming.

**Example Concept:**
Explain the principle of least privilege and why it is important for system security.
*Solution:* The principle of least privilege states that a user or process should be given only the minimum access rights needed to perform its tasks and no more than that. This reduces the risk of a compromised account doing wider damage to the system.
