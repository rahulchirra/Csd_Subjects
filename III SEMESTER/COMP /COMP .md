-   **Interrupts:** Signals that require immediate attention from the microprocessor.
-   **Interrupt Vector:** A memory address pointing to an interrupt service routine.
-   **Interrupt Service Routine (ISR):** A set of instructions executed when an interrupt occurs.
-   **Interrupt Number:** To map each interrupt with an address.
-   **Structure of the Interrupt Vector Table:** Organization of interrupt vectors.
