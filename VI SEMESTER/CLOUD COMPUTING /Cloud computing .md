### **üí° Computing Paradigms**

Overview of various computing paradigms.

*   **High-Performance Computing (HPC):**  Focuses on solving complex problems requiring massive computational power, often used in scientific research, engineering, and simulations.
*   **Parallel Computing:**  Using multiple processors to execute a program simultaneously, breaking a large problem into smaller subproblems that can be solved in parallel, usually in the same system.
*   **Distributed Computing:**  Spreading computations across multiple interconnected computers, where each system works independently, but coordinates to complete a bigger task, and can span over a large network of computers.
*   **Cluster Computing:** Using a group of interconnected computers (nodes) to work together as a single system to perform a computational task, for example for running large applications in high performance computing.
*   **Grid Computing:**  A more loosely coupled approach than cluster computing, that connects diverse computing resources to work together in a virtualized manner across a wide geographic location.
*   **Cloud Computing:** A model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services).
*   **Bio computing:**  Using computer science to solve problems in biology, and often used for DNA sequencing, drug discovery and protein structure analysis.
*   **Mobile Computing:**  Computing using portable wireless devices, such as smart phones, tablets and laptops, with the ability to perform computations on the device or remotely over the internet.
*   **Quantum Computing:** A computing approach based on quantum mechanics, using properties like superposition and entanglement to solve problems that cannot be solved using classical computing, and often used in drug design and cryptography.
*   **Optical Computing:**  Using light photons, instead of electrons, to perform computations, with higher speed, parallelism, and lower energy consumption.
*  **Nano computing:** Using components at nanometer scale for computing, creating circuits and architectures at nanometer level, and is used to build very powerful, and smaller devices.

**Example Concept:**
What is the main difference between parallel and distributed computing?
*Solution:* Parallel computing uses multiple processors within a single system to solve a problem, whereas distributed computing uses multiple interconnected computers that work together over a network, and each computer works independently but coordinate together.

### **‚ú® Cloud Deployment Models**

Exploring various cloud deployment models.

*   **Four Cloud Deployment Models:**
    *   **Public Cloud:** Cloud infrastructure is available for public use, owned and operated by a third-party provider, and is often pay-as-you-go and is readily available for anyone.
    *   **Private Cloud:** Cloud infrastructure is operated solely for a single organization, within their firewall, and is used for better control and security.
    *   **Hybrid Cloud:**  A combination of public and private clouds, using a mix of resources from both and allowing for greater flexibility and scalability.
    *   **Community Cloud:** Cloud infrastructure is shared among several organizations with similar interests, for example, a cloud for government agencies, universities or hospitals, with shared resources and governance.

**Example Concept:**
When is a private cloud preferred over a public cloud?
*Solution:* A private cloud is preferred when an organization needs greater control, security, and customization of its infrastructure, often due to regulatory compliance, sensitive data, or specific performance requirements.
